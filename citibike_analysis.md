# Des Moines IA Bike Program Analysis Summary

## Population 
### What is the population of Des Moines? 
How does its population compare to the population of New York City? 
The population of over 8 Million in NYC is much much larger than the less than 1 Million in Des MoinesDoes. The difference does impact the number of riders who will use the bike sharing program, however proportionally the percentage of potential users in Des Moines population is similar to that of NYC when we dive a little deeper in to the breakdown by Gender and Group in the NYC program we find similarities in the potential gender and age groups.

### What is the gender diversity of Des Moines? 
Des Moines Gender breakdown between Malke and Female potential riders is almost 50/50 (Female 50.8%). In NYC we find that most riders who take advantage of the program are between 60%-80% Male. With the percentages increasing in alignment with the older age groups. This can translate in to a potentially succesful ridership and membership population for the program.

### What is the density of McDonald's in New York City versus Des Moines? 
Based on what the analysis has shown I believe there is a higher density of McDonal's in Des Moines & West Des Moines simply because we find a similar count of stores in proportion to the overall population in the respective cities. There is no evidence in the data about how this might translate in more ridership, more analysis is needed to determine the correlation between McDonal's store presence and the use of the bikes program.

The presence of these restaurants may indicate a lot of research done by McDonals and their target customers, wether or not there is an overlap between these and the ridership proram is unclear.

## Conclusion
The ridership program in Des Moines has potential based on the many tour bike programs, weather and trourist atractions in Des Moines. With  over 800 miles of bike and hike trails the infrastructure is present to support the use of bikes without having to develop additional bike lanes for rider safety. Most trails in Desmoines are recreational but there are many which intersect with the many businesses restaurants and commercial areas which signal a potential customer base for both recreational and daily commute.
